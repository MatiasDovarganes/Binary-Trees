# Word Chain
This project implements a word chain solver using a graph-based approach, where words are represented as vertices and edges connect words that differ by a single letter. The graph is built by grouping words into "buckets" based on common patterns, allowing efficient traversal. Using breadth-first search (BFS), the program can find all possible transformation paths between words, while a specialized shortest path function identifies the most efficient sequence. This project demonstrates the power of graph algorithms in linguistic puzzles and real-world applications like spell checking and word ladder games.
